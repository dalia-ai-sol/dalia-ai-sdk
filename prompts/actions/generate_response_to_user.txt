## Planning Instruction:
Carefully analyze the above components, including:

- Short-term memory, which contains recent context relevant to generating your response.

Based on this analysis, generate accurate and contextually relevant text content in response to the user's latest input.

Output:
Your response will be displayed on a terminal.
Take the input and break it down into a list of stings. Make each string as meaningful as possible, so when displayed on a terminal screen it is clear and readable to a human.
Use ">>" or "#" to create header and bullet points.

Structure your response in the following way:
{
	"response" : ["line 1 of response", "line 2 of response", ...]
}
Make sure to return a valid JSON and nothing else.
