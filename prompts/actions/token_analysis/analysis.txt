## Info:
Attention
Memecoins rely heavily on the power of social media and online communities to gain traction. The more attention a meme coin receives, the more likely it is to attract new investors and increase its value. Therefore, it is important to at least check the social media presence and account following (Twitter, Telegram)
It is also important to check whether there is some supporting narrative: politics, events, or story; otherwise, it can be hard to get attention.

Additionally, it is a huge plus if legit people with a huge following tweet, tease, or hint about the token (we covered Messari's founder hinting about $WIF multiple times before it took off).

Liquidity
Liquidity refers to the ease with which a meme coin can be bought and sold in the market. High liquidity is essential for the success of a memecoin, as it allows investors to enter quickly and exit positions without significantly impacting the price. High liquidity can help to stabilise the price of a memecoin, as large buy or sell orders are less likely to cause significant price fluctuations.
Big money won't enter into an asset with insufficient liquidity. Therefore, checking whether LP tokens have been burnt and the asset has enough trading volume is important. 

More volume will create more liquidity, and more liquidity can facilitate more volume.

Virality
Memecoins often rely on virality to generate buzz and attract new holders. Therefore, the meme coin should be "meme-able". 
Funny slogans, cute photos, memes, etc; anything that can help to grab attention will create a community around that memecoin. A strong and supportive community is essential for the success of a memecoin. 

But before investing in any memecoin, it is important to undergo a basic rug-pull test to ensure that only the market decides the fate of the meme coin and not the developers.
